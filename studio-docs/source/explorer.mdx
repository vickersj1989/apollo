The Explorer in Studio is a GraphQL client for authoring and managing your operations.
It provides a rich workspace, complete with all the basics of query editing (syntax highlighting, autocomplete, etc.) and a significant number of additive features that are entirely unique to the Explorer.

We know how important it is that your developer tools _stay out of your way_, and the Explorer has been designed and built with great care for the small details and nuance of editing environments.

## Editor basics

The Explorer’s operation editor is built on Monaco, and includes all the usual conventions we expect from query-building tools (such as ⌘+Enter to run, state persistence across sessions, and panels for providing headers and variables). The editor also provides full IntelliSense support for GraphQL, including query linting, autocomplete, peek definitions on hover, jump-to-definition with a command-click, and more.

The editor is also able to manage multiple operations and reason about those operations individually. As you're working, the editor will shift focus to whichever operation you've clicked in to. Each operation has its own context menu where you can copy its contents to CURL, copy a link to share, format it, etc.

## Query building

The Explorer's three column layout lets you keep your schema's documentation open at all times if you'd like.

The documentation in the Explorer is designed to let you "step into your schema". As you step further, it keeps track of your current path. This path helps you navigate back up your schema via breadcrumbs, and it tells Explorer exactly how to reach your current location from the root.

At any point, you can click the (+) button next to a field in the documentation and the Explorer will add that field to your query along the path you've walked through the docs. The Explorer will also automatically generate variables for you (a preference you can turn on/off, but variable notation is sometimes tedious to write out).

The query builder will help you build variables just as it helps you build queries. Clicking the (+) next to input objects will help you generate JSON in your Variables editor just as easily as it helps you build your operations.

## Search

The Explorer comes with a two-step search that helps you both identify what you're looking for in your schema, and then **a path to get to there**. The second step here is especially crucial because search mechanisms are not complete in the context of query building if they do not help you find _how_ to get what you want once you've identified what you're looking for.

This is one of the things we felt was most lacking in GraphQL tooling before the Explorer.

### Step 1: Identify a field

The first step of search helps you identify exactly which type-field pairing you’re looking for.

If you know you’re looking for a field named `email`, the Explorer helps you identify whether you want `User.email` or `Organization.email`. And if you’re less sure about the field’s name, Explorer uses a fuzzy search, so you can get it a little wrong. You can also include a `.` modifier to search both type and field names simultaneously, which can help you narrow in on the perfect match.

### Step 2: Find a path to the field

After you identify which type-field pair you want, the Explorer runs a breadth-first search from your schema’s entry points (`Query`, `Mutation` and `Subscription`) to the chosen field. It lists all of the paths it finds, ordered by length. After you select which path you want, the Explorer opens it for you in the Documentation panel, and you can add it to your query with a click.

Step 2 of search walks you through the available paths one step at a time to narrow down your options before choosing your final path. There can sometimes be thousands of path options to a single location in the graph, and some filtering at that point is very helpful.

## Features

Beyond the basics of query editing, query building, and search, the Explorer has a number of other rich features. Most of these features are unique to the Explorer and not available in other GraphQL clients.

### Dark mode

The Explorer comes in both light mode and dark mode, because we don't think we could have lived without both.

### Subscriptions support

The Explorer comes with first-class support for running subscriptions. You can run queries, mutations, and subscriptions all within the same workspace (no need for separate tabs). You can start and stop listening to your subscriptions at will and see new information as it comes in and old information as it goes stale. You can set your websocket endpoint independently from your http endpoint.

### Operation history

The Explorer will save a small history of the queries and variables you've run recently to your local storage and provide you with access to them via the History tab. This is helpful when trying to recover previous work and keep your workspace clean while retaining past operations.

### Mocked responses

You can turn on the "Mock responses" option in the Explorer Settings page. This will naively mock responses based on the types in your schema, rather then sending your operations over the wire to your endpoint. This can be helpful if you want to get a feel for what your query responses will be without having an endpoint available, or if you want to get a mocked response to use as a sample or put in a test.

### Download responses

You can copy responses from your operations with a button or download any given response to a local JSON file.

### Response hints

You can turn on the "Use response hints" option in the Explorer Settings. As you build your query, the Explorer will run partial queries under the hood and show you their results inlined in the editor. This is helpful when trying to get a sense of the data you'll get back in your full operation response, and can also be really helpful to get quick answers from queries without having to even hit the Run button.

The Explorer will not show hints for mutations (we don't want to be running partial mutations).

### Field latency hints

As an alternative to response hints, the Explorer can also show you hints for the general latency of the fields in your query. This is an option that's available if you've set your graph up to also report field usage and tracing data to Studio.

The Explorer will show you the 95th percentile response times for the fields in your query to help you get a sense of "how expensive" your query is and what the bottlenecks in response time will be.

### `graphql-lodash` integration

The Explorer [extends your schema with `graphql-lodash`](https://github.com/APIs-guru/graphql-lodash) on the client side, so you can write queries that include lodash directives and they will resolve correctly. This is quite helfpul if you want to manipulate your response data into into a specific format for exporting, or of if you want to do some quick analysis without needing to export.

Here's an example of a query using `graphql-lodash`. You can try pasting this in the Explorer embedded at http://apollographql.com/studio/develop:

```graphql:title=example.graphql
query StarWarsGenderStats {
  genderStats: allPeople @_(get: "edges") {
    edges @_(countBy: "node.gender") {
      node {
        gender
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### View responses in table form

You can view any response from a query or mutation as either JSON or a table. If you turn on table mode, the Explorer will do its best to render your data in table form. This is extremely useful when trying to read arrays of data and generally makes your data more readable, especially to folks who aren't developers.

### Inline/Extract variables

At any point when editing your operations, you can switch between inlined or extracted variable notation with the click of one button. This is an option in "..." context menu next to each of your operations.

This is extremely useful when you want to switch modes to quickly copy and paste something, or when you are drafting a query in the editor and wanting to move it to code.

Inlined variable:

```graphql:title=query.graphql
query {
  user(id: "Beth Harmon") {
    name
  }
}
```

Extraced variable:

```graphql:title=query.graphql
query($id: ID!) {
  user(id: $id) {
    name
  }
}
```

```json:title=variables.json
{
  "id": "Beth Harmon"
}
```

### Query plans for federated graphs

If you're working with a federated graph in Studio, the Explorer will dynamically calculate query plans for your in the right panel (an option under the Responses tab). As you edit your query, the Explorer will recalculate your query plans and show you their updates.

## Setup

To use the Explorer, create a graph in Studio and navigate to the Explorer page. The Explorer will ask you where your graph is running when you try to run your first query. You can change the URL the Explorer makes requests to at any time under the Explorer Settings tab.

Queries in the Explorer are sent directly from your browser to your endpoint and do not pass through Apollo's systems. Apollo does not ever see your request headers or your response data.

### CORS policies

Requests from the Explorer go straight from your browser to your endpoint, so your endpoint will see requests coming from https://studio.apollographql.com domain.

It is common for public endpoints to have CORS policies that restrict which domains are allowed to query them. If your endpoint has CORS protections enabled, you will likely need to safe-list https://studio.apollographql.com in your CORS policy to use the Explorer.

If changing your CORS policy is not possible, another option is to write a small proxy to your endpoint, and to point the Explorer to your proxy instead. CORS policies are enforced by browsers, and your proxy will not have the same issues communicating to your endpoint.

## Local development

Unline other GraphQL clients, the Explorer will is load its schema context from what you register to Studio by default, not from introspecting your graph. The benefits of this approach are that:

- We can provide documentation and schema intellisense even when your endpoint may have introspection turned off (common in production).
- We can provide information about directives, which introspection does not support.

If you want to use the Explorer for local development and to have it actively listen for changes and update itself, you should create a "Development" graph in Studio (https://studio.apollographql.com/dev).

Dev graphs will introspect your local endpoint and poll for changes. If a new schema is detected, dev graphs will pull this change and update themselves automatically without you having to refresh anything. Dev graphs have a setting where you can pause introspection polling if you want to.

## Authentication

There are a few basic options for setting up authentication with the Explorer right now.
We are very open to hearing about your authentication requirements and to working with you direction to set up authentication to your graph from within the Explorer.
Please don't hesitate to reach out to support@apollographql.com with questions on authentication – we'll be in touch.

### Headers

There is a headers section of the Explorer editor where you can set authentication headers. It is common to authenticate by setting tokens in that area directly:

```json
{
  "Authentication": "bearer <TOKEN>"
}
```

> **Note:** If you would like to configure your graph to add default headers for any request from the Explorer (across all users in your account), this feature is available in beta form. Please get in touch with support@apollographql.com to request access. This can be useful if you need to send a consistent identifier or override for requests coming from the Explorer, for example.

### Cookies

If your graph authenticates using cookies, you can configure your endpoint to share those cookies with https://studio.apollographql.com.

Once set up, requests sent from https://studio.apollographql.com will carry the cookies from your domain when you run queries with the Explorer.
If you're logged in on your domain, requests from the Explorer will be logged in. Once you log out on your domain and the cookie is removed, requests from the Explorer will be logged out.

To set this up, your [cookie's value must contain `SameSite=None; Secure`](https://www.chromium.org/updates/same-site) and these CORS headers must be present in your server's response to Studio:

```bash
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://studio.apollographql.com
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

### Preflight Scripts (beta, available on request)

[Much like Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/writing-scripts/pre-request-scripts/), we have an ability for you to execute JavaScript before your request runs.
This capability can be used to facilitate parts of the OAuth flow. In particular, preflight scripts are very useful for using refresh tokens to keep your authentication tokens valid without constant manual intervention.

Preflight scripts can also be persisted to users across your account, so you can set up an authentication script for your graph and other members of your team will be able to use it as well.

We have [detailed documentation on how preflight scripts work](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-studio-community/blob/main/preview-docs/PreRequestScripts.md).
If this would be useful to you, please get in touch with support@apollographql.com to request access for your account.

## Distribution

Right now the Explorer is available for free, unlimited use in Apollo Studio. It is not available for download or on-prem distribution at this time. This is something we have given considerable thought to and may do in the future, but our goal for now is to build the best possible Explorer experience for you from within Studio.
