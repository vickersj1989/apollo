The Apollo Studio Explorer is an interface for creating, running, and managing GraphQL operations:

It provides a rich workspace, complete with all the basics of query editing (syntax highlighting, autocomplete, etc.) and a significant number of additive features that are entirely unique to the Explorer.

> Operations in the Explorer are sent directly from your browser to your GraphQL server, _without_ passing through Apollo's systems. Apollo does not ever see your request headers or response data.

## Setup

To get started with the Explorer, [create a graph](./getting-started/#2-create-your-first-graph) in Studio and navigate to the Explorer tab. The Explorer will ask you for the URL of your running GraphQL server when you try to run your first query. You can change this URL at any time from the Explorer's Settings tab.

## The operation editor

The Explorer’s operation editor is built on [Monaco](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/), and includes all the usual conventions we expect from query-building tools (such as ⌘+Enter to run, state persistence across sessions, and panels for providing headers and variables). The editor also provides full IntelliSense support for GraphQL, including query linting, autocomplete, peek definitions on hover, jump-to-definition with a command-click, and more.

The editor is also able to manage multiple operations and reason about those operations individually. As you're working, the editor will shift focus to whichever operation you've clicked in to. Each operation has its own context menu where you can copy its contents to CURL, copy a link to share, format it, etc.

## Building a query

The Explorer's three column layout lets you keep your schema's documentation open at all times if you'd like.

The documentation in the Explorer is designed to let you "step into your schema". As you step further, it keeps track of your current path. This path helps you navigate back up your schema via breadcrumbs, and it tells Explorer exactly how to reach your current location from the root.

At any point, you can click the (+) button next to a field in the documentation and the Explorer will add that field to your query along the path you've walked through the docs. The Explorer will also automatically generate variables for you (a preference you can turn on/off, but variable notation is sometimes tedious to write out).

The query builder will help you build variables just as it helps you build queries. Clicking the (+) next to input objects will help you generate JSON in your Variables editor just as easily as it helps you build your operations.

## Search

The Explorer comes with a two-step search that helps you both identify what you're looking for in your schema, and then **a path to get to there**. The second step here is especially crucial because search mechanisms are not complete in the context of query building if they do not help you find _how_ to get what you want once you've identified what you're looking for.

This is one of the things we felt was most lacking in GraphQL tooling before the Explorer.

### Step 1: Identify a field

The first step of search helps you identify exactly which type-field pairing you’re looking for.

If you know you’re looking for a field named `email`, the Explorer helps you identify whether you want `User.email` or `Organization.email`. And if you’re less sure about the field’s name, Explorer uses a fuzzy search, so you can get it a little wrong. You can also include a `.` modifier to search both type and field names simultaneously, which can help you narrow in on the perfect match.

### Step 2: Find a path to the field

After you identify which type-field pair you want, the Explorer runs a breadth-first search from your schema’s entry points (`Query`, `Mutation` and `Subscription`) to the chosen field. It lists all of the paths it finds, ordered by length. After you select which path you want, the Explorer opens it for you in the Documentation panel, and you can add it to your query with a click.

Step 2 of search walks you through the available paths one step at a time to narrow down your options before choosing your final path. There can sometimes be thousands of path options to a single location in the graph, and some filtering at that point is very helpful.

## Additional features

Beyond the basics of query editing, query building, and search, the Explorer has a number of other rich features. Most of these features are unique to the Explorer and not available in other GraphQL clients.

### Authentication

The Explorer currently provides the following options for authentication. If your graph has authentication requirements that aren't covered by these options, please contact us at **support@apollographql.com** with questions or feedback.

#### Request headers

The bottom of the Explorer editor provides a Headers section where you can set headers that are included in your operation's HTTP request.

For example, you can provide a bearer token in an `Authentication` header like so:

```json
{
  "Authentication": "bearer <TOKEN>"
}
```

> **Beta feature:** You can specify default headers that are applied to _every_ Explorer request executed by _every_ user in your organization. This can be useful if you want to provide a consistent identifier to your server for requests coming from the Explorer. To request access to this beta feature, please contact **support@apollographql.com**.

#### Cookies

If your graph authenticates using cookies, you can configure your endpoint to share those cookies with https://studio.apollographql.com.

Once configured, requests sent from https://studio.apollographql.com will carry the cookies from your domain when you run queries with the Explorer. If you're logged in on your domain, requests from the Explorer will also be logged in. If you log out on your domain and the cookie is removed, requests from the Explorer will be logged out.

To set this up, your [cookie's value must contain `SameSite=None; Secure`](https://www.chromium.org/updates/same-site). Additionally, these CORS headers must be present in your server's response to Studio:

```bash
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://studio.apollographql.com
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

#### Preflight Scripts (beta)

> To request access to preflight scripts, contact **support@apollographql.com**.

[Much like Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/writing-scripts/pre-request-scripts/), we have an ability for you to execute JavaScript before your request runs.
This capability can be used to facilitate parts of the OAuth flow. In particular, preflight scripts are very useful for using refresh tokens to keep your authentication tokens valid without constant manual intervention.

Preflight scripts can also be persisted to users across your account, so you can set up an authentication script for your graph and other members of your team will be able to use it as well.

We have [detailed documentation on how preflight scripts work](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-studio-community/blob/main/preview-docs/PreRequestScripts.md).
If this would be useful to you, please get in touch with support@apollographql.com to request access for your account.

### Building operations

#### Mocked responses

> Enable **Mock responses** from the Explorer's Settings tab.

This feature naively mocks operation responses based on your schema's types, instead of sending your operations over the wire to your endpoint.

Mocked responses are helpful if you want to get a feel for the shape of a query's response when your endpoint isn't available, or if you need a quick response to use in a code sample or a unit test.

#### Response hints

> Enable **Use response hints** from the Explorer's Settings tab.

As you build your query, the Explorer runs partial queries under the hood and shows their results in-line. This is helpful when you want to get a sense of the data you'll get back in your full operation response. It can also help you retrieve a quick answer to a query without needing to click the Run button.

The Explorer does not show response hints for mutations (this requires running partial mutations, which is unsafe).

#### Field latency hints

As an alternative to [response hints](#response-hints), the Explorer can show you hints for the latency of the fields in your query. This option is available only if you've configured your graph to [report field usage and tracing data to Studio](./setup-analytics/).

The Explorer shows you the 95th-percentile response times for the fields in your query to help you get a sense of "how expensive" your query is and what the bottlenecks in response time will be.

#### `graphql-lodash` integration

The Explorer [extends your schema with `graphql-lodash`](https://github.com/APIs-guru/graphql-lodash) on the client side, so you can write queries that include lodash directives and they will resolve correctly. This is helfpul if you want to manipulate your response data into into a specific format for exporting, or if you want to do some quick analysis without needing to export.

Here's an example of a query that uses `graphql-lodash`. You can try pasting this in the Explorer embedded at http://apollographql.com/studio/develop:

```graphql:title=example.graphql
query StarWarsGenderStats {
  genderStats: allPeople @_(get: "edges") {
    edges @_(countBy: "node.gender") {
      node {
        gender
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Inline/Extract variables

At any point when editing your operations, you can switch between inlined or extracted variable notation with the click of one button. This is an option in "..." context menu next to each of your operations.

This is extremely useful when you want to switch modes to quickly copy and paste something, or when you are drafting a query in the editor and wanting to move it to code.

Inlined variable:

```graphql:title=query.graphql
query {
  user(id: "Beth Harmon") {
    name
  }
}
```

Extraced variable:

```graphql:title=query.graphql
query($id: ID!) {
  user(id: $id) {
    name
  }
}
```

```json:title=variables.json
{
  "id": "Beth Harmon"
}
```

### Local development

Unline similar GraphQL clients, the Explorer obtains your server's schema from Apollo Studio by default, _not_ by introspecting your server. This has the following benefits:

* The Explorer can provide documentation and schema IntelliSense, even if your endpoint has disabled introspection (this is common for production graphs).
* The Explorer can provide information about directives, which introspection does not support.

You can still use the Explorer for local development. To do so, create a [development graph](https://studio.apollographql.com/dev) in Studio.

A dev graph uses introspection to fetch your schema from your local endpoint, and it also polls regularly for changes. Whenever a new schema is detected, the dev graph pulls this change and updates itself automatically. You can also pause introspection polling at any time.

### Saving operations

#### Operation history

> View your operation history from the Explorer's **Run history** tab.

The Explorer saves the history of your recently run operations (and the variable values for those operations) to your browser's local storage. Access your history to retain and recover previous work without cluttering your editor.

#### Downloading responses

You can copy responses from your operations with a button or download any given response to a local JSON file.

### Networking

#### CORS policies

Requests from the Explorer go straight from your browser to your GraphQL server, so your endpoint will see requests coming from the `https://studio.apollographql.com` domain.

It's common for public endpoints to have CORS policies that restrict which domains can query them. If your endpoint has CORS protections enabled, you probably need to safe-list https://studio.apollographql.com in your CORS policy to use the Explorer.

If you can't change your CORS policy, you might be able to write a small proxy to your endpoint and point the Explorer to the proxy instead. CORS policies are enforced by browsers, and the proxy won't have the same issues communicating to your endpoint.

### Federation

#### Query plans for federated graphs

If you're working with a federated graph in Studio, the Explorer will dynamically calculate query plans for your in the right panel (an option under the Responses tab). As you edit your query, the Explorer will recalculate your query plans and show you their updates.


### Display

#### Dark mode

Toggle between light and dark mode from the Explorer's Settings tab.

#### Table layout for response data

You can view an operation's response as JSON or as a table. Table layout is especially useful when your response includes an array, or when you want to share a query's results with someone who isn't familiar with JSON.


## FAQ

### Does the Explorer support subscription operations?

Yes. You can run queries, mutations, and subscriptions all from the same Explorer page. You can start and stop listening to subscriptions, and you can see new subscription data as it comes in and old information as it becomes stale. 

You can also set your server's subscription websocket endpoint independently from the HTTP endpoint for queries and mutations.

### Is the Explorer available for on-prem distribution?

Not at this time. The Explorer is available for free, unlimited use in Apollo Studio, but it is not available for download or on-prem distribution. This might change in the future, but for now our goal is to provide the best possible Explorer experience from within Studio.
